# **kube-matrix-2**

## **Overview**

**kube-matrix-2** is a structured, modular Kubernetes deployment framework designed to manage multiple environments consistently. It enables teams to follow GitOps principles, reuse modules, automate deployments, and maintain clean, scalable environment configuration.

This project aims to standardize how Kubernetes environments (dev, staging, prod) are defined, bootstrapped, and deployed.

## **Key Features**

* Multi-environment Kubernetes configuration

* Clean directory-based separation of concerns

* Reusable modules for infra and application deployments

* GitOps-friendly repo structure

* Automation workflows (GitHub Actions)

* Sanity test suite for quick verification

## 📌 Project Implementation
This project implements an enterprise-grade Internal Developer Platform with:

- Terraform S3 backend + DynamoDB Lock Table
- AWS Networking (VPC, Subnets, NAT, IGW, Endpoints)
- Amazon EKS Cluster with ALB and Autoscaling controllers
- Aurora MySQL Serverless v2 Database
- Amazon ECR for container image storage
- IAM roles, policies, and security boundaries
- Developer access via kubeconfig generation
- CI/CD-ready environment separation (Dev, Stage, Prod)

## **Getting Started**

### **1\. Clone the repository**
